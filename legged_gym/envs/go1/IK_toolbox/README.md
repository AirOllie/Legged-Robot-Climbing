# locomotion_pybullet_python

Build the pybullet simulation environment for legged robots motion planning and control(coding by python.3.6)

run "go1_torque_controller.py" for quadrupedal locomotion control

The Pinocchio dynamic library is used for robot-computation: 

Note: the .exe library (generated by external c++ code, see github repo: "Bipedal_locomotion_nmpc_for_pybullet") is employed for fast gait planing and optimization.
